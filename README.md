# RPi-CM4-Kicad
Schematic symbols and footprint for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 for KiCad

# Notes
There are two symbols - divided to units by connectors or function

The footprint has 3D modules attached, STEP module for RPi CM4 is very large (60MB+) and can slow down your KiCad. The footprint it taken from Raspberry Pi Official IO board KiCad Files (converted down from V5.99 to V5). Its origin is moved to center of the connectors so it should be simple to convert it to two connectors for BOM and pick and place files....
